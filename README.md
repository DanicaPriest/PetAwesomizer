# PetAwesomizer
Application that allows users to search for adoptable pets in their area using the Petfinder API and replaces the description of the pet with a Chuck Norris fact from the Chuck Norris API.
Users can search pets based on animal, age, gender and choose how many results they want to return. There is also a random pet button that returns a random pet from the Petfinder API.

*The Petfinder API is currently down for users in the EU. I am working on a replacement api and will update.
