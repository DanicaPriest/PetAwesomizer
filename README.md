# PetAwesomizer
Application that allows users to search for adoptable pets in their area using the Petfinder API and replaces the description of the pet with a Chuck Norris fact from the Chuck Norris API.
Users can search pets based on animal, age, gender and choose how many results they want to return. There is also a random pet button that returns a random pet from the Petfinder API.

I've now added a button that reports content as inappropriate and adds it to a database of reported content. The reported fact will then never show up again.
